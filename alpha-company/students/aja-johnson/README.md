## About Me <a name="aboutme"/>
Hello world! I'm Aja Johnson.

Write some "about me" stuff here.

## My Training Overview <a name="training"/>
Explore the training I've received and development community experiences I've had as a student in CoderVets Alpha Company.

## Software Development Training <a name="skills"/>
I've learned key software development skills and gained exposure and experience in the following technical and practice areas in the CoderVets "Alpha Company" program.

### Computer Science / Programming Foundations <a name="computerscience"/>
As part of CoderVets training, I studied MIT's Introduction to Computer Science and Programming course. [This is what I learned][5] about Computer Science and Programming.
### Agile / Scrum <a name="agilescrum"/>
I learned all about agile software development principles and values during CoderVets training, including scrum tactics. I gained experience working on an agile / scrum team and developing a fieldwork project together. [Here is what I know and have experienced][6] with Agile / Scrum.
### Design <a name="design"/>
During CoderVets fieldwork training, our development team participated in the Google Ventures Design Sprint. Good software starts with [good design.][7]
### Version Control / Git <a name="versioncontrol"/>
I became a Jedi with version control / git. Commits. Pushes. Pulls. Pull requests. Merges. Merge conflicts. We did many exercises, and it's almost [second nature to me now.][8]
### Coding <a name="coding"/>
Of course I did [a lot of coding][9] in the CoderVets program!
### React.js Developer Certification <a name="reactjsdevcert"/>
I completed all of the necessary coursework to earn the [React.js Developer Certification][10] from LinkedIn Learning/ Lynda. I'm ready to build full-stack apps in today's most in-demand Javascript framework!
### Fieldwork Project <a name="fieldworkproject"/>
One of the central challenges of the CoderVets training program is "learning by doing." I contributed to a real-world [fieldwork project][11] during training!
### Optional Courses <a name="optionalcourses"/>
There were also some [optional courses][12] I was exposed to and had the opportunity to work on in the program.

## Contact / Hire Me <a name="contacthire"/>
I'm ready to develop and deliver software! Here are some ways we can connect and work together.

### Contact Me <a name="contactme"/>

### Operation Code community <a name="operationcode"/>
Join the Operation Code community. It's free. Then come chat with me and others in the military community who are learning to code together on the Operation Code Slack channels -- a community of over 3,000 strong! It's about camaraderie and shared mission. CoderVets is proud to be an official chapter and partner of Operation Code.
